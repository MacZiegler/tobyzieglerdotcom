            <p>These pages are undergoing a complete rebuild from scratch, so you are likely to encounter the under construction <a href="../underconstruction.php">page</a> as you look around.</p>
            <p>I am gradually building and adding in, so I am going to try to keep this sidebar updated with what's going on for the next few days and weeks.</p>
            <p>At the moment I am wide open for suggestions on how to improve anything you see here. I won't promise to implement anything, but I definitely appreciate the advice!</p>

            <p>The latest changes are additions to the notes and bio sections, as well as further progress posting portfolio pieces. Enjoy!</p>

        <h2>Hello, and welcome to my site.</h2>
        <p>I have many stories to tell, and these pages are where I will be sharing them.</p>
        <p>I am in the process of rebuilding everything from scratch, so you are likely to encounter the under construction <a href="../underconstruction.php">page</a> as you look around. Much of what you will encounter here is experimental for me, and for the near future, unfinished.</p>
        <p>Choices are still being made. Background photos? Colors? Sprites? How much compatibility should I accommodate? Some parts are headed for a SQL/PHP approach. Perhaps others should be just a slideshow. Perhaps not. Decisions, decisions&#8230</p>
        <h3>About these pages,</h3>
        <p>I know it's not great for web traffic and page rankings, but I have included a &quotback&quot button as the first option in the navigation bar. If you don't feel like sticking around, I want you to know I fully support your decision. If you decide to stay and browse, I hope you find I have made it worth your while.</p>
        <p>The <a href="portfolio/portfolioindex.php">portfolio</a> section is mostly self-explanatory, and will be increasing in size for a while.</p>
        <p>Now for the <a href="notes/notesindex.php">notes</a>: I have coded all these pages by hand. In this section I am going to try to share my reasoning. One of the more difficult tasks may be in getting the process explained before I have changed to an approach I feel might be better. I will give it a shot, though.</p>
        <p>In the <a href="bio/bio.php">bio</a> section you will find a bit about me, including a version of my <a href="bio/resume.php">resume</a>, if you are interested. Throw in a fairly standard <a href="contact.php">contact</a> page and you have the full tour.</p>
