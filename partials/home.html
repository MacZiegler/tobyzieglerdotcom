                    <p>Welcome to my pages.</p>
                    <p>I have built and rebuilt and destroyed and broken and fixed these pages over and over since
                        about
                        1995.</p>
                    <p>For the latest version you see now, I started saying, "Pride Goeth Before the Rebuild"...</p>
                    <p>I had built my pages with pride. I had built my pages with care. I had done it all by myself.</p>
                </section>
                <section class="w3-col l3 m6">
                    <p>Suddenly, I just couldn't stand them. They had to go.</p>
                    <p>I carefully hand-crafted every line of code. No dependencies. Everything from scratch. Often
                        inspired by others, but always worked out and implemented by me, myself and I.</p>
                    <p>I spent <strong><em>so</em></strong> much time getting everything right, functionally, visually,
                        you
                        name it -- that I didn't
                        ever get to add but a fraction of the actual content I wanted to show here.</p>
                </section>
                <section class="w3-col l3 m6">
                    <p>So it has to go. I am bringing in Bootstrap, jQuery, Angular, and every other dependency I once
                        eschewed.
                        Well, at least the ones which will make things go faster and allow me to focus more on the
                        content and style
                        of these pages, instead of just the mechanics.</p>
                    <p>The mechanics are fine, and I love them. Unfortunately, unless I point them out in code
                        snippets,
                        almost no one is going to be able to appreciate them but the afore-mentioned me, myself and I.
                        While I
                        don't need anyone else's approval, explicit or otherwise, one of the primary reasons I am
                        putting this here is
                        to share.</p>

                    <p>Here you will find a tiny sliver of my work. I took every photo and composed every phrase.</p>
                    <p>Since these pages are undergoing a complete rebuild from scratch, so you are likely to encounter
                        the
