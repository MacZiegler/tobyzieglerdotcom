            Just a brief note: This was just supposed to be a minimal blurb about myself. Apparently I am more narcissistic than I thought,
            so I am breaking the things I just wouldn&#8217t quit typing into sub-pages...

    <p>First I suppose I should describe myself. According to my wonderful wife, I&#8217m a geeky eccentric who thinks he is
        far funnier than he really is.
        <br/>Turns out she is pretty good with labels.</p>
    <p>Whatever.
        <br/>I&#8217m frickin&#8217 hilarious.</p>
    <p>That said, I seem to also have some sort of unintended predilection for accomplishing my life goals the hard way.</p>

    <label for "a02">What to do after high school</label>
    <p>I suppose I could start with the dilemma of choosing my post-high school career. Like most of the world, I had no idea
        what I wanted to be when I grew up. Not sure I do yet, just to be brutally honest. If I could have had my dreams
        come true, I think I would have chosen to graduate college with the career of independently wealthy retired.</p>
    <p>I just couldn&#8217t figure that one out, somehow.</p>
    <p>So, I used interest and aptitude tests to try to narrow down the options. I found out both my interests and aptitudes
        were ALL over the map. I eventually &#8220narrowed&#8221 my choices down to actor, artist, author, engineer, programmer
        or wall street wizard.</p>
    <p>As I examined these choices, I ticked each off the list:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Actor:
            <ul>
                <li>One in a million actors actually get discovered and make it to the big time. The rest seem to become food
                    servers until they eventually give up. If it were just about talent or drive, I might have pushed forward.
                    Too much of this is apparently just dumb, blind luck.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Artist:
            <ul>
                <li>The profession single most well known for starving. For some reason, no matter how much I showed interest
                    and aptitude for art, the concept of starving really put me off. Add in the fact most artists only seem
                    to become rich and famous posthumously, and it became a non-starter.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Author:
            <ul>
                <li>Similar to acting, only a small percentage even make it to earning a decent living, much less the fame and
                    fortune of the big names. My preferred subject is the not-so-popular (then) genre of science fiction,
                    which helped dissuade me. I bet I would have been good at it, though.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Engineer:
            <ul>
                <li>A lot going on with this one. My aptitude scores were always high here, along with a ton of interest. These
                    are the people who
                    <em>design</em> things. Real things. After all, I LOVED Legos. What I did not love was the concept of spending
                    years designing a landing gear or a spark plug. I knew a large part of engineering is rather tedious.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Programmer:
            <ul>
                <li>Talk about tedious! I was really put off by debugging. The thought of spending day after day searching for
                    the comma which should have been a semi-colon was mind-numbing. Even though I had written my first &#8220Hello
                    World!&#8221 on a university mainframe using punch cards, I had no idea how much of that workload is
                    facilitated by any decent IDE. I had already spent lots of time scratching my head and growling at monitors
                    trying to get Basic code to just plain work.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Wall Street Trader:
            <ul>
                <li>I had a head for certain kinds of numbers. Accounting wasn&#8217t really a thing for me, though. Still, even
                    moderately successful traders seemed to accumulate quite a bit of money. Ironically, I really didn&#8217t
                    want to be a person motivated by dollar signs, or driven to keep getting bigger and bigger numbers in
                    some sort of highest score competition.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>So, what to choose?</p>
    <p>The optimizer in me didn&#8217t want to waste a single credit hour taking a course not counting toward some final goal.
        Years later I counted about 25 that did exactly that.</p>
    <p>In the end, I chose engineering.</p>
    <p>I knew in my heart what I
        <em>really</em> wanted to do was jockey jets. I had grown up watching interceptors in the skys around military bases
        and I ached to be in a cockpit.</p>
    <p>Since my nearsightedness and motion sickness ruled out any cockpits from my future, I decided to become an aerospace
        engineer instead. If I couldn&#8217t fly &#8217em, I would design &#8217em instead.</p>
    <p>Whew!</p>
    <p>There is a lot more to tell here than I realized.</p>
